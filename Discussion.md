## Solutions Considered

### Approach 1: Linear Search for Logs
Initially, I considered using a linear search to find log entries by looping through all the log lines. This would have been easy to implement but inefficient for large log files, especially for 600MB logs.

### Approach 2: Regular Expressions
I considered using regular expressions to search for logs based on patterns. While this approach can be powerful, it may not be optimal for simple date-based filtering and could slow down for large files.

### Approach 3: Optimized Filtering with Date Prefix
The final approach I selected was filtering log entries based on a date prefix. This method is simple, efficient, and easily scalable for large files.
